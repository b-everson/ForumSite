Get database logic out of pages

Fix code for paging --BETTER, Session isn't a good way to handle paging, using 
    query strings now, but need to fix implementation, last page in particular

Remove hidden password and username inputs on master page, was used with 
SqlDataSource on page before the user panel is generated in code behind, now I 
will do the database read in the code file instead of using the SqlDataSource
